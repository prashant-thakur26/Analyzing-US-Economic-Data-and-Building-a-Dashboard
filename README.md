# Analyzing-US-Economic-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard Using Python
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this Project I will extract some essential economic indicators from some data, I will then display these economic indicators in a Dashboard. I can then share the dashboard via an URL.  Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. In this lab, I will examine how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate. I will take screen shots of Dashboard, I will share the notebook and the URL pointing to the dashboard.
